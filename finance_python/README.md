## [Technical Stock Analysis](https://github.com/amanpanditap/Python_Projects/tree/main/finance_python/technical_stock_analysis)
What Is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?<br/>
Relative Strength Index is an overbought/oversold indicator that attempts to predict trend reversal points. RSI is based on the observation that a stock which is advancing will tend to close nearer to the high of the day than the low. The reverse is true for declining stocks. This indicator can also be used when comparing two different equities on a relative basis. RSI's absolute levels are 0 and 100. Buy signals are triggered at 30, and sell signals are triggered at 70. One of the important aspects of RSI is to look for divergence between price action and RSI. Upward sloping price and downward sloping RSI should be taken as a warning.
